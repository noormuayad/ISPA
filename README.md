# Introduction to Dataset

The provided dataset contains information related to education, specifically focusing on students' performance and characteristics. It includes data from multiple countries and aims to provide insights into students' academic abilities, socio-economic backgrounds, and other factors that may influence their educational outcomes. The dataset consists of various columns, each representing a specific attribute or characteristic of the students.

# Data Wrangling Project: Analyzing ISPA Dataset

The data wrangling project aims to prepare the ISPA dataset for analysis by performing essential data cleaning, exploration, and transformation tasks. The following steps can be considered as part of the project:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing or null values in the dataset.
   - Check and address any inconsistencies or errors in the data.
   - Standardize data formats and units, if necessary.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understand the distribution of variables and identify any outliers.
   - Explore relationships between different columns to uncover potential insights.
   - Conduct statistical summaries and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new variables or derive meaningful features from the existing ones.
   - Group or categorize variables to simplify analysis or improve interpretability.

4. **Data Transformation:**
   - Perform data normalization or scaling, if required.
   - Handle categorical variables through encoding or dummy variable creation.
   - Aggregate or reshape the data to a more suitable format for analysis.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document all the steps taken during the data wrangling process.
   - Provide explanations for any decisions made or assumptions taken.

By completing these data wrangling tasks, the dataset will be cleaned, organized, and ready for further analysis or modeling. It is important to adapt the specific steps and techniques according to the project's goals and the questions to be addressed using the dataset.

## Analysis and Modeling
- we conducted an analysis to examine the relationship between parent education, parent nationality, and out-of-school study time for students. The main goal was to identify how the educational background and nationality of parents influence the amount of time students spend studying outside of school.

### Data Exploration

We started by exploring the dataset and examining the variables related to parent education, parent nationality, and out-of-school study time. We analyzed the distribution of these variables and looked for any initial insights.

### Statistical Analysis

To assess the impact of parent education and nationality on out-of-school study time, we performed statistical analysis. We utilized various techniques, such as correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, to identify significant relationships and measure the strength of the associations.

### Results

Our analysis revealed interesting findings regarding the influence of parent education and nationality on student study habits. The results indicated that:

- Students whose parents have higher education tend to spend more time studying outside of school compared to those with parents who have lower education levels.
- The nationality of parents also plays a role in out-of-school study time, with certain countries showing a higher tendency for students to dedicate more time to studying.

### Modeling

To further investigate the impact of parent education and nationality on out-of-school study time, we developed predictive models. We employed machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression or decision trees, to build models that could predict the study time based on the given features.

### Conclusion

Through our analysis and modeling, we demonstrated the significance of parent education and nationality in influencing the study habits of students. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, educators, and parents, as they can help tailor educational strategies and support systems to improve student outcomes.
